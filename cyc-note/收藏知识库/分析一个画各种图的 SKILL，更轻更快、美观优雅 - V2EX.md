[分析一个画各种图的 SKILL，更轻更快、美观优雅 - V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com/t/1239246#reply8) 

 A house style for hand-written SVG diagrams your agent can follow — the layout arithmetic, the colour system, and a zero-dependency linter that proves it did.

Install
-------

Paste this to your coding agent:

```null
Install the svg-diagram skill from https://github.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram
for me by running: npx skills add bybit-exchange/svg-diagram -g

```

Or run it yourself:

```null
npx skills add bybit-exchange/svg-diagram -g

```

The CLI detects which agents you have installed and writes each one's path. Drop `-g` to install into the current project instead.

| Surface | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/svg-diagram/` |
| Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot, opencode, Antigravity | `~/.agents/skills/svg-diagram/` — they share one directory |
| Pi | `~/.pi/skills/svg-diagram/` |
| Windsurf, Continue, Roo, Goose, Kiro, Trae and 40+ more | `~/.<agent>/skills/svg-diagram/` |
| [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) | Zip the folder and upload it under Settings → Capabilities → Skills (skill text only — `svg-lint` needs local Node) |

Every path is named from the skill's frontmatter `name`, not from where the skill sits here, so moving files in this repository doesn't change them.

`[SKILL.md](http://skill.md/)` is at the repository root, so the install copies the root and `svg-lint` comes along with the skill text. The linter has no dependencies, so it runs from wherever it landed:

```null
node ~/.claude/skills/svg-diagram/tools/svg-lint/bin/svg-lint.mjs diagram.svg

```

If you only want the skill text, take the one file the agent reads:

```null
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/svg-diagram
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/main/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/svg-diagram/SKILL.md

```

The skill works on its own that way; `svg-lint` is what you give up.

Then start a new session and ask for a diagram — the agent should announce that it's using `svg-diagram`.

Gallery
-------

Ten diagrams, all drawn under this skill and all lint clean. Each one is here for the rule it demonstrates.

### How an agent loads a skill

Two dashed containers side by side. Connectors cross the channel between them, and a colour change marks the point where a request matches.

### The authoring loop

A cross-layer loop-back line, painted after the boxes so they don't cover it.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/02-workflow-svg-authoring.svg)

### Where the lint gate sits

A self-call that leaves its lifeline and curves back to it, its second control point sharing the end point's y so the arrowhead closes level and points at the participant rather than down the lifeline.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/03-sequence-lint-gate.svg)

### From a data API to a document figure

CJK labels sized from the CJK column of the width table — one full font size per character, 12px rather than 7.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/04-dataflow-metrics-to-doc.svg)

### The life of a skill in this repo

One semantic colour triple per state. Each forward arrow carries the colour of the state it leaves.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/05-lifecycle-skill-states.svg)

### What's in this repository

A dashed border only where the contents are actually drawn — `gallery/` and `assets/` are directories too, but their members aren't in the figure, so they stay plain boxes.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/06-architecture-repo-layout.svg)

### One command, every agent

A one-to-many fan-out whose branch curves keep each second control point level with the end point, so every arrowhead lands pointing right.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/07-workflow-install-surfaces.svg)

### Why the font stack cannot be dropped

A contrast pair built from two semantic triples: the working paths in green, the branch that fails in pink.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bybit-exchange/svg-diagram/refs/heads/main/gallery/08-reference-cjk-fonts.svg)

### Tiered model routing behind one gateway

A symmetric fan-out and convergence, one triple per tier. Only the middle leg leaves the rule box's bottom edge; the two outer ones leave its sides.

![](https://www.v2ex.com/t/gallery/09-dataflow-tiered-routing.svg)

### A/B benchmark with a model as judge

A dashed group box around exactly the steps that repeat. The return edge is painted last, so it stays legible where it crosses the wall.

What the skill pins down
------------------------

| Area | What's pinned down |
| --- | --- |
| Layout | viewBox margins of 20–25px, the title centred on the content centre rather than the viewBox, and off-centre content shifted with a single `<g transform="translate(dx,0)">` |
| Boxes | Height derived from the font — one line is `font-size × 3`, each extra line adds `font-size × 1.5` — and boxes sharing a row whose sizes differ by no more than 60px |
| Connectors | A straight `L` only when the two ends are co-axial, a `C` or `Q` curve for anything that turns, and no right-angle elbows |
| Arrowheads | A notched marker with `markerUnits="userSpaceOnUse"`, sized to the line's stroke width, starting 5px clear of the source and ending 11px short of the target |
| Text | Baseline at `box y + height/2 + font-size × 0.35` to centre inside a box, and at least 10px of clearance from a straight connector — 15px from a curve, with the label above a downward bend and below an upward one |
| Fonts | 16px titles, 12px box text, 10px annotations, over a stack that keeps `Noto Sans CJK SC` so Linux rendering doesn't fall back to tofu |
| Colours | Five semantic fill/stroke/text triples applied through presentation attributes — no CSS classes, no media queries |
| Escaping | `&`, `<`, `>`, `"` and `'` escaped in text and attributes, and anything from a database or an API escaped before it's concatenated into the file |

Every diagram also paints its own white canvas rect as the first element, so it reads as a light card on GitHub's dark theme instead of dark text on a dark background. That isn't theme switching. The diagram carries one colour set, and the rect exists only so that set stays readable wherever the file is embedded.

The full rules — the character width tables, the six arrowhead colour variants, the coordinate bookkeeping, and a twenty-item verification checklist — are in [SKILL.md](https://www.v2ex.com/t/SKILL.md), which is the single source of truth.

Why
---

*   **Checked on the real artifact.** The linter reads the finished SVG, not an intermediate format. Nothing sits between the receipt and the file you ship.
*   **Zero dependencies.** `svg-lint` is plain Node with no packages. It runs in a fresh clone, with no install step and no lockfile.
*   **Placed, not auto-laid-out.** The skill hands the agent the arithmetic — box height, baseline offset, arrow clearance, block spacing — so every element lands somewhere chosen rather than somewhere a layout engine picked.
*   **Findings name the fix.** A failure reports the value it found and the value it should hold: `viewBox: 11 → 20–25`, not "the margin looks wrong".
*   **CJK-safe by default.** A mandatory font stack, plus separate character-width tables for Latin and CJK, so labels are checked for overflow before they're placed.
*   **Reviewable as text.** Every coordinate is a literal, annotated with a comment explaining why it holds that value, so a change to a diagram reads as a diff instead of a re-render.
*   **Plain SVG out.** No runtime, no viewer, no JavaScript. It renders in a README, a docs site, a PDF and a terminal preview.

The lint gate
-------------

`svg-lint` reads the finished SVG and reports what the house style forbids. It's a maintainer tool, run by hand. Nothing invokes it for you, so run it before you hand a diagram over.

```null
node tools/svg-lint/bin/svg-lint.mjs diagram.svg
node tools/svg-lint/bin/svg-lint.mjs diagram.svg --json

```

Try it on a deliberately broken file:

```null
printf '%s' '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 200 60" width="200"><text x="50" y="20" font-size="12">Load & Save</text></svg>' > /tmp/broken.svg
node tools/svg-lint/bin/svg-lint.mjs /tmp/broken.svg

```

That reports 3 errors and 7 warnings and exits 1: the unescaped `&`, the missing font stack, the missing white canvas rect, an off-palette fill, four viewBox margins outside the 20–25px range, and asymmetric margins on both axes. Each finding carries the id of the check that raised it and a repair line:

```null
  1:1  error  No <style> rule declares font-family for text  [font-stack/missing-font-stack]
         repair: font-family: absent → 'PingFang SC', 'Microsoft YaHei', 'Noto Sans CJK SC', system-ui, sans-serif · SKILL.md marks this non-negotiable

```

The 12 checks cover XML escaping, viewBox clipping, the font stack, box height, baseline offset, block spacing, arrow markers, text overflow, overlap, light-background fallback, palette conformance and connector geometry. A thirteenth id, `document-model`, raises no findings of its own. It's how the model layer reports what it couldn't read, so the geometry checks never draw conclusions from coordinates they got wrong.

> `0 errors, 0 warnings` is the only pass; a warning is a failure.

Exit codes, the `--json` shape, and what each check does and doesn't catch are in [tools/svg-lint/README.md](https://www.v2ex.com/t/tools/svg-lint/README.md). [SKILL.md](http://skill.md/) carries a troubleshooting table for the symptoms that reach you before the linter does.

Contributing
------------

This repository holds one skill, and the `[SKILL.md](http://skill.md/)` at the root is it.

Frontmatter takes `name` and `description`; `license` and a `metadata` map (version, author, requirements) are welcome too. `name` is what every install path keys off. The `description` is what the agent matches on, so write it as "what it covers + when to use it" — that line is the trigger, and the body costs nothing until the work matches it.

Before you open a PR, use the skill for a real task in a fresh session. If the agent didn't load it on its own, the description needs work; if the output still needed manual correction, the body is missing a rule — or the linter is missing a check.

Diagrams committed here must pass clean, and the test suite has to stay green:

```null
npm run lint:svg:all   
npm test               

```

Everything under `tools/svg-lint/test/fixtures/` is excluded from the lint run — for the 14 under `fail/`, failing is their job, and the 2 under `pass/` are asserted by the test suite instead.
